# genshin-recipes
This project was made to ensure understanding of incredibly basic HTML
skills. By the end of the project, we should have learned how to
link images, create paragraphs, use standard boilerplates, and more.

What I learned:
- Using standard boilerplates for HTML
- Created links to other folders that contains the recipes
- Linking img sources to provide pictures of the dish
- Creating links, unordered and ordered lists

Recipes+images were taken from Genshin Impact
